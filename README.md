Harvester to get Manuscript Images from Handrit.is
By Madita Kn√∂pfle (m.knoepfle@unibas.ch)

LokaleHandrit, as LokaleSamlinger by Balduin Landolt, aims to easily download images from Handrit.is. Of course, the images still belong to Handrit.is !
To quote Balduin: "This program does nothing else, than to spare you some clicking work.
Just think of it, as if you had downloaded the images manually."
